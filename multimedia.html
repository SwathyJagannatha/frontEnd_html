<!-- 1. Embedding Multimedia in Educational Content
 Objective: The aim of this assignment is to enhance the delivery of educational content through the effective use of multimedia elements in a web page. By embedding images, audio, and video, students will learn to create more engaging and interactive educational resources.

 Task 1: Embed an Educational Image Create an HTML page and embed an image that illustrates the concept you're teaching. Add a caption using the <figcaption> element to describe the image. 

 Task 2: Include an Instructional Audio Clip Embed an audio clip that provides a brief explanation or reading of the concept. Ensure the audio is accessible with playback controls.

Expected Outcome: A web page with an embedded audio clip that plays an explanation of the chosen concept, complete with controls for play, pause, and volume.

Task 3: Integrate an Informative Video Incorporate a video that visually explains the concept. The video could be a lecture, an animation, or a documentary clip related to the topic. -->
