<!-- 2. Crafting a Semantic Web Document
Task 1: Define the Page Structure Use semantic elements to define the basic structure of your web page, including a header, navigation, main content, and a footer.

Task 2: Organize Content Using Articles and Sections Within the <main> element, use <article> and <section> tags to organize the content related to your topic. Use headings (<h2> to <h6>) to title each section or article appropriately.

The web document must employ semantic HTML5 elements to structure the content logically and accessibly.
The page should make appropriate use of <article>, <section>, <nav>, <header>,  <main> , and 
<footer>  elements where relevant to the content.
Headings should be used to structure the content hierarchically, improving both readability and accessibility. -->

      <h2>What is AI?</h2>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence, or <em>AI</em>, is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate<strong>human intelligence</strong> and problem-solving capabilities.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        As a field of computer science, artificial intelligence encompasses (and is often mentioned together with) machine learning and deep learning. These disciplines involve the development of AI algorithms, modeled after the decision-making processes of the human brain, that can ‘learn’ from available data and make increasingly more accurate classifications or predictions over time.

        <h3><strong> AI Ethics and Governance Observatory</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Getting AI governance right is one of the most <em>consequential challenges</em> of our time, calling for mutual learning based on the lessons and good practices emerging from the different jurisdictions around the world.
        </p>
        <h4>The aim of the Global AI Ethics and Governance Observatory is to provide a global resource for policymakers, regulators, academics, the private sector and civil society to find solutions to the most pressing challenges posed by Artificial Intelligence.</h4>
        <blockquote>
            <h4>The Observatory showcases information about the readiness of countries to adopt AI ethically and responsibly.</h4>
            <h5>It also hosts the AI Ethics and Governance Lab, which gathers contributions, impactful research, toolkits and good practices.</h5>
